# SLAM -> Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

## NEEDS
install GUI features to see video or image
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install -y libgl1 libglib2.0-0

## TODO
- feature extraction -> identifies points in the image that are trackable 
- switch form containers to local

### NOTES
- cv2 (opencv) is computer vision library, contains over 2500 algorithms 
- using flask is silly...
