Got it. You are doing Monocular Visual SLAM.

You have a video (let's say video.mp4) and you want to write code that watches that video, figures out how the camera moved, and generates a cloud of points (the map).

The very first step isn't the map. It is Feature Extraction.

You cannot map a wall. You can only map points on a wall that look unique (corners, edges, specks of dirt). If your code cannot find these points in the video, it cannot do SLAM.

Here is the code for Step 1.
Prerequisites

You need Python and OpenCV.
Run this in your terminal:
code Bash

    
pip install opencv-python numpy

  

Step 1: Feature Extraction (The "Eyes")

This code will load your 1-minute video and identify the points that the SLAM algorithm will use to build the map.

Create a file named slam_step1.py:
code Python

    
import cv2
import numpy as np

# 1. Load your video
# Replace 'test_video.mp4' with the path to your actual video file
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('test_video.mp4')

if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Error: Could not open video.")
    exit()

# 2. Initialize the Feature Detector
# ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) is standard for SLAM.
# It finds corners and texture details.
orb = cv2.ORB_create(nfeatures=3000)

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # 3. Detect Features
    # 'kp' are the keypoints (locations x,y)
    # 'des' are the descriptors (mathematical description of what the point looks like)
    kp, des = orb.detectAndCompute(frame, None)

    # 4. Visualization
    # Draw colorful circles on the points the computer "sees"
    img2 = cv2.drawKeypoints(frame, kp, None, color=(0,255,0), flags=0)

    cv2.imshow('SLAM Step 1: Feature Extraction', img2)

    # Press 'q' to quit
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

  

What to look for when you run this:

    Green Rings: You should see hundreds of little green rings on the video. These are the "Features."

    Texture: Notice that the rings appear on corners, keyboards, tree leaves, or rough surfaces. They will not appear on plain white walls or blue skies. SLAM fails on plain surfaces.

    Stability: As the camera moves, do the green rings stay "stuck" to the objects? Or do they flicker in and out?

Run this code. If you see the video playing with the green dots, you have completed Step 1.

Ready for Step 2? Step 2 is Feature Matching (tracking those specific green dots from Frame 1 to Frame 2 to calculate speed). Tell me when you are ready.
